## Project plan3

### Project description

This project will employ a part-time Digital Inclusion Communications Coordinator at our Learning Centre at the G31 Centre, a community center in the heart of Camlachie, Glasgow. The G31 Learning Centre is part of the wider John Wheatley Learning Networn, and is run in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College.

The Coordinator role will include facilitating the Learning Centreâ€™s operation, registering new users and assisting service users in getting the most out of equipment and software. The Coordinator will work alongside the Regeneration Department at WSHA in the creation and continual evaluation of a timetable of activities at the G31 Learning Centre to ensure that the community's needs are being addressed.

The Coordinator will also liaise with key partners and other local service users - particularly existing G31 Centre users - to create sustainable partnerships and encourage further cross-demographic use of the ILC facilities, focusing in particular at engaging the Over 60s tenants, Benefit Seekers and those with mental and physical disabilities. This will be achieved through organising focus groups and holding workshop sessions to identify key needs, and subsequently generating project ideas to meet these needs.

### Month 5

This requires all users who have signed up to the Network to re-open their accounts in order to gain access to the G31 Learning Centre and other members of the wider network. Resultantly, Niamh and Marco held a session with one of the G31 Centre's staff on Wed 5th Aug to re-register a number of previous users who have expressed interest in continuing to use the G31 Learning Centre.

This event, organised in collaboration with Thriving Places, attracts a range of attendees from across Glasgow, including Older People and some John Orr Day Care service users who experience learning difficulties.

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Our goal is to increase the number of tenants in disadvantaged communities engaging in digital technology, focusing on the following demographics and milestones:

- Older People: we aim to engage with 200 of our over 60s tenants through our existing Club60 programme, and through liaison with the Sheltered Complexes

- Disabilities: we aim to egage with 100 service users, via the Accord (in G31 Centre), Care UK and The Mungo Foundation (both of whome have facilities in Camlachie)

- Benefit Seekers: currently our partners Jobs & Businesses Glasgow and Glasgow Homelessness Network engage with 20-30 service users at the ILC. We wish to expand this number to 200-250 users over the next year.
