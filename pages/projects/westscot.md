## Project plan

### Project description

This project will employ a part-time Digital Inclusion Communications Coordinator at our Learning Centre at the G31 Centre, a community center in the heart of Camlachie, Glasgow. The G31 Learning Centre is part of the wider John Wheatley Learning Network, and is run in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College.

The Coordinator role will include facilitating the Learning Centre’s operation, registering new users and assisting service users in getting the most out of equipment and software. The Coordinator will work alongside the Regeneration Department at WSHA in the creation and continual evaluation of a timetable of activities at the G31 Learning Centre to ensure that the community's needs are being addressed.

The Coordinator will also liaise with key partners and other local service users - particularly existing G31 Centre users - to create sustainable partnerships and encourage further cross-demographic use of the ILC facilities, focusing in particular at engaging the Over 60s tenants, Benefit Seekers and those with mental and physical disabilities. This will be achieved through organising focus groups and holding workshop sessions to identify key needs, and subsequently generating project ideas to meet these needs.

- 7th July 2015 : Niamh was introduced to the G31 Centre Staff and given a full induction to the G31 Learning Centre computer suite.
- 15th July 2015 : Niamh visited Denmilne Gardens Sheltered Complex with Alison Cameron (WSHA's Older Persons Coordinator) to touch base with some of the residents, and to attempt to identifiy avenues through which to engage with Older People. Niamh will attend Denmilne Gardens at the end of a current Arts & Crafts project to introduce some of the community to digital communication.
- 23rd July 2015 : Niamh and Marco visited Dawn McManus from Thenue Housing to learn about how they utilise digital technology to facilitate Community Engagement and Employability programme.
- 29th July 2015 : Niamh and Marco met with Sarah Barnes from Glasgow Kelvin College to touch base, re-assess the G31 Learning Centre's timetable and discuss the inauguration process for a new year's worth of Learning Network sign-ups.
- 29th July 2015: Niamh met with WSHA's financial wellbeing team to discuss future money advice sessions at the Inclusive Learning Centre, and the potential involvement of Credit Unions as part of a wider money-saving service

### Month 5

- 5th August 2015 : All part of the John Wheatley Learning Network centres have begun the 2015-2016 year starting 31st July/1st August. This requires all users who have signed up to the Network to re-open their accounts in order to gain access to the G31 Learning Centre and other members of the wider network. Resultantly, Niamh and Marco held a session with one of the G31 Centre's staff on Wed 5th Aug to re-register a number of previous users who have expressed interest in continuing to use the G31 Learning Centre.
- 5th August 2015 : Niamh attended the weekly Tea Dance at the G31 Centre. This event, organised in collaboration with Thriving Places, attracts a range of attendees from across Glasgow, including Older People and some John Orr Day Care service users who experience learning difficulties. The Tea Dance was cited as an excellent opportunity to meet with some Older People, and local service users with Disabilities. 
- 5th August 2015 : Niamh was introduced to Mhairi from Axis (North Glasgow Healthy Living Commmunity) and a volunteer from the Camlachie Communtiy who have exptressed interest in further involvement in the G31 Learning Centre in collaboration with the John Orr Day Care service offered by Care UK.
- 6th August 2015 : On Dawn McManus' suggestionNiamh and Marco visited the Thenue Housing Association weekly drop-in aimed at giving IT support to Older People in the Bridgeton and Calton areas. This was useful to touch base with similar services and avoid service duplication.

 - 6th August: Niamh makes contact with a Community Development Officer from Age Scotland, Charlie Murphy, about the iTea & Biscuits initiative that Age UK ran in the past. The project aims to bring a range of organisations together to promote and celebrate the benefits of digital inclusion for people in later life. Charlie was eager to revive the project and collaborate with WSHA on delivering a course in the G31 Centre for our older tenants. 
11th August: Niamh & Marco met with Stephen and Frances Bradley from Glasgow Life, to find out about the types of courses they deliver. It was discovered that they do mostly taster sessions and then they tend to promote and sign-post after that. To set up a tutor-led session in the G31 centre, they require a minimum of 6 tenants to express interest. Following this meeting, the sustainability of these courses arose as an issue, as the courses are more ‘awareness-raising’ in nature. E.g. They run a Glasgow History/Family History course, and can do this remotely for a couple of weeks, but with the expectation that customers would eventually attend sessions in the Mitchell Library, which conflicts with what we’re trying to achieve, i.e. increased use of the computer suite facility in the G31 Community Centre. 
 - 11th August: Marco & Niamh met with Rosemary from Care UK, which coordinates the John Orr Day Care group, a group of people with a range of physical and mental disabilities. The John Orr group already make use of the computer suite one afternoon a week, but this is not tutor-led so they are not able to grow and develop their IT capabilities. Off the back of this meeting, Marco put in an application to Kelvin College for a specialised tutor to lead the group in an IT session every week at the G31 Centre.
 - 12th August: Niamh & Marco met with Kelly Glass from SCYP (South Camlachie Youth Project), whose offices are based in the G31 Centre.  The idea of a digital newsletter for 11-12 year olds was discussed – this would be a 16-20 week programme, and there is the potential that this could be delivered in the G31 Centre computer suite. 
 - 19th August: Marco & Niamh develop a flyer to promote the weekly IT drop-in session at the G31 Centre. These are distributed around the Camlachie community.
 - 20th August: Niamh attends Thenue Housing Association weekly drop-in again to gain further insight to this type of service and build experience and confidence in the provision of IT support to service-users. 
 - 25th August: Niamh visits Veronica at Tollcross Housing Association to learn about their Digital Inclusion programme. Veronica provided Niamh with resources that would enable her to guide a tenant through the use of Universal Credit. She also invited Niamh back to the Job Club so that she could gain experience in delivering a job search session. 
 - 26th August: The first IT drop-in session is held at G31 Centre from 1pm to 5pm. 2 Camlachie residents pick up registration forms but don’t stay. Niamh identified 4 potential service-users at the weekly Tea Dance, which also takes place in G31 Centre at this time. 
2nd September: Second IT drop-in session. One person attended, needing assistance with operating her tablet. This advice session lasted approximately 1 hour and the kinds of topics covered were: camera use; making sense of WiFi; using Widgets. Niamh also engaged with the women from the previous week – they were still interested in receiving IT support but had forgotten to bring their personal devices with them. 

Month #6

 - 8th September: Marco & Niamh meet with Donna from Healthy North Glasgow and Dawn McManus & Shayron Anderson from Thenue. The meeting was to discuss using the G31 computer suite to deliver an 8-week IT support programme to accompany the Axis HIIC course. 
 - 9th September: Third IT drop-in session. The woman from the week before sent her husband to Niamh for help operating his new smart phone. This session lasted approximately 2 hours. For the next 2 weeks, this husband and wife return to Niamh for further assistance on their devices. 
 - 17th September: Digital Inclusion Outreach visit – Niamh went to Linthaugh Gardens with the Older Person’s Coordinator, Alison to explore the idea of holding IT sessions in their communal area. Engaged with 2 people who were interested, both of whom have their own laptops/iPads already, but wished to improve their skills. Looked into WiFi options for the common room.  - 23rd September: nobody attended the drop-in session. However one of the volunteers working in the centre asked Niamh for internet job-searching and CV-building advice, on behalf of her 16-year old who had just left school. 
 - 30th September: nobody attended the drop-in session. Marco and Niamh reviewed how effective this time-slot is and decided not to hold it again until we came up with an alternative. 

Month #7

 - 1st October: Niamh visited more WSHA sheltered housing on Witch Road in Kilmarnock, with Alison & Michelle the Volunteer Coordinator. There was a coffee afternoon held in the common room, to encourage tenants to give us their ideas for a weekly social activity. Attendance was poor; however Niamh identified one tenant who was in need of IT support. This tenant had additional needs due to him having a stroke 3 years before. Niamh is looking into signposting him to an AAC (Augmentative & Alternative communication) service in Ayrshire. 
 - 21st October: Niamh attends the first Health Issue In the Community (HIIC) session, to provide IT support for the participants, in conjunction with Healthy North Glasgow and Thenue HA. This session takes place for the next 7 weeks. During these 7 weeks, participants write an essay on their chosen health issue and prepare a PowerPoint presentation, to be delivered in front of an audience. 


Month #8

 - 12th November: Niamh visits sheltered housing complex at Witch Road in Kilmarnock. Identifies 2 gentlemen who would like to learn basic IT skills and who need help with operating their personal tablet. 
 - 26th November: Niamh begins another IT drop-in session at the G31 Centre. Flyering for this was done previously, around the Camlachie area as well in the Bridgeton area (JobCentre, library and Citizens Advice). Nobody turns up on Day 1. 
 

Month #9

 - 8th December: Niamh and Marco visit Witch Road to help a tenant set up his tablet, and to deliver sign-up forms for a local IT skills class. 
 
 




## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Our goal is to increase the number of tenants in disadvantaged communities engaging in digital technology, focusing on the following demographics and milestones:

- Older People: we aim to engage with 200 of our over 60s tenants through our existing Club60 programme, and through liaison with the Sheltered Complexes

- Disabilities: we aim to egage with 100 service users, via the Accord (in G31 Centre), Care UK and The Mungo Foundation (both of whome have facilities in Camlachie)

- Benefit Seekers: currently our partners Jobs & Businesses Glasgow and Glasgow Homelessness Network engage with 20-30 service users at the ILC. We wish to expand this number to 200-250 users over the next year.
